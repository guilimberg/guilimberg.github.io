I’m interested in most things <a href="https://www.annualreviews.org/doi/full/10.1146/annurev-astro-032620-021917" style="text-decoration: none">Galactic archaeology</a> (or ‘<a href="https://www.annualreviews.org/doi/10.1146/annurev-astro-082214-122423" style="text-decoration: none">near-field cosmology</a>’), but my esearch mostly focuses on the Galactic halo. The pillar of this discipline is the idea that, given the different properties of the a galaxy's stellar populations, it should be possible to reconstruct their distinct formation pathways. Because stars retain a long-term ‘memory’ of their origins in both the chemical compositions of their atmospheres as well as in their kinematics, we can leverage these information to study the formation/evolution of both our Galaxy and its dwarf satellites on a star-by-star basis.

Admittedly, I am someone ‘born’ in the <i>Gaia</i> era. Most of what I do revolves around astrometric and spectro-photometric data provided by the <a href="https://www.cosmos.esa.int/web/gaia" style="text-decoration: none"><i>Gaia</i> space mission</a> for <a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021ApJ...907...10L/abstract" style="text-decoration: none">metal-poor stars</a>. Also, I make extensive usage of data from large-scale spectroscopic surveys (e.g., <a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022ApJ...935..109L/abstract" style="text-decoration: none">APOGEE</a>, <a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021ApJ...913L..28L/abstract" style="text-decoration: none">GALAH</a>, and <a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2023ApJ...946...66L/abstract" style="text-decoration: none">SEGUE</a>) to obtain a full chemodynamical view of these old stellar populations. I also perform observations and analysis of <a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021ApJ...913...11L/abstract" style="text-decoration: none">low-</a> and <a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2024MNRAS.530.2512L/abstract" style="text-decoration: none">high-resolution spectra</a> myself, in particular to derive chemical abundance patterns of stars.

More specific topics of my interest include metal-poor stars, stellar streams and overdensities, star clusters, dwarf galaxies, including both low- and high-resolution stellar spectroscopy.
