I’m a final-year PhD student (or ‘candidate’) in Astronomy at Universidade de São Paulo (USP) in Brasil under supervision of Prof. <a href="https://bv.fapesp.br/en/pesquisador/4078/silvia-cristina-fernandes-rossi/" style="text-decoration: none">Silvia Rossi</a>. My research focuses on the field of Galactic Archaeology, but mostly on the Milky Way’s halo, including its metal-poor stellar populations, phase-mixed substructures, stellar streams and overdensities, globular clusters, and dwarf galaxies (see ‘research’ tab). After having 'Galactic and extragalactic astrophysics' classes with Prof. <a href="http://www.astro.iag.usp.br/~pcoelho/" style="text-decoration: none">Paula Coelho</a> and reading Cris Chiappini's article on the <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1X0c73WWPZ5eCieziwhk7rPKvDwvDHFJS/view?usp=sharing" style="text-decoration: none">formation of our Galaxy</a> still as an undergrad, I became fascinated by how we can learn about general processes of galaxy evolution using the Milky Way and its satellites as nearby laboratories.

For the 2022/23 academic year, I’m staying as a visitor at University of Chicago working with Prof. <a href="https://www.alexji.com/" style="text-decoration: none">Alex Ji</a>’s Near-field Cosmology group.

I was born and raised in São Paulo, which is probably why I think Chicago is small. Yes, I do like football, but my true love is carnaval. I’m also a really big enthusiast of Brazilian modern music. Checkout my <a href="https://open.spotify.com/user/7gyzjytyu5wjfox7fx81xt0wk?si=ad336202a9af490c&nd=1" style="text-decoration: none">Spotify</a> for some of my favorite artists. (:

Here in the US, I’ve recently fallen in love with NYC after a one-week trip there. Sorry Chicago, but you truly are too small for me.

<!---For site content, there is one markdown file for each type of content, which are stored in directories like _publications, _talks, _posts, _teaching, or _pages. For example, each talk is a markdown file in the [_talks directory](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/tree/master/_talks). At the top of each markdown file is structured data in YAML about the talk, which the theme will parse to do lots of cool stuff. The same structured data about a talk is used to generate the list of talks on the [Talks page](https://academicpages.github.io/talks), each [individual page](https://academicpages.github.io/talks/2012-03-01-talk-1) for specific talks, the talks section for the [CV page](https://academicpages.github.io/cv), and the [map of places you've given a talk](https://academicpages.github.io/talkmap.html) (if you run this [python file](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/talkmap.py) or [Jupyter notebook](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/talkmap.ipynb), which creates the HTML for the map based on the contents of the _talks directory).

Many people use a git client to create files on their local computer and then push them to GitHub's servers. If you are not familiar with git, you can directly edit these configuration and markdown files directly in the github.com interface. Navigate to a file (like [this one](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_talks/2012-03-01-talk-1.md) and click the pencil icon in the top right of the content preview (to the right of the "Raw | Blame | History" buttons). You can delete a file by clicking the trashcan icon to the right of the pencil icon. You can also create new files or upload files by navigating to a directory and clicking the "Create new file" or "Upload files" buttons.
